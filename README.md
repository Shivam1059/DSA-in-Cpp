# DSA_in_C++

Welcome to the **DSA_in_C++** repository! This project contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It's designed to help learners and developers deepen their understanding of DSA concepts, improve coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Table of Contents
- **Arrays**: Operations like insertion, deletion, rotation, and searching
- **sorting**: merge sort, bobble sort, quick sort
- **seaching**: liner search, binary search,
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, circular linked lists
- **Stacks and Queues**: Basic operations and applications
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and other tree traversals
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms
## About this repo

This repository covers essential data structures and algorithms, all implemented in C++. Itâ€™s intended for learners of all levels, whether you are:
- Preparing for coding interviews
- Strengthening your knowledge of DSA
- Looking to improve your C++ coding skills

The code is clean, well-documented, and each implementation is paired with examples to illustrate usage.
